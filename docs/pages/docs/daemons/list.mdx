# List of Daemons

## ðŸ“°â€‚Data from Yearn Meta
The [Yearn Meta](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-meta) repository and API contains all the metadata of the Yearn ecosystem. Contents of the [`data`](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-meta/data) directory are synced to IPFS for storage, accessible through our API [meta.yearn.finance](https://meta.yearn.finance). Consistency of the stored data is verified by smalls scripts and schemas.  

Yearn Meta is mostly used to provide some human classification or overwrite for some data.

### Vaults from Meta
- **Endpoint**: `https://meta.yearn.finance/api/:chainID/vaults/all`  
- **Description**: The [vaults](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-meta/tree/master/data/vaults) directory contains a bunch of relevant information about each Yearn Vaults.    
- **Trigger**: The Daemon will refresh the data every **24 hours** to assert the data is up-to-date.  
- **Automation**: An external webhook is connected to the API to ask for a refresh of the data once a new commit to the `master` branch is performed on the [Yearn Meta](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-meta) repository.  

### Tokens from Meta
- **Endpoint**: `https://meta.yearn.finance/api/:chainID/tokens/all`  
- **Description**: The [tokens](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-meta/tree/master/data/tokens) directory contains a bunch of relevant information about each tokens that may exits in Yearn's ecosystem.    
- **Trigger**: The Daemon will refresh the data every **24 hours** to assert the data is up-to-date.  
- **Automation**: An external webhook is connected to the API to ask for a refresh of the data once a new commit to the `master` branch is performed on the [Yearn Meta](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-meta) repository.  

### Strategies from Meta
- **Endpoint**: `https://meta.yearn.finance/api/:chainID/strategies/all`  
- **Description**: The [strategies](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-meta/tree/master/data/strategies) directory contains a bunch of relevant information about each strategies that may be attached to a Yearn Vault.  
- **Trigger**: The Daemon will refresh the data every **24 hours** to assert the data is up-to-date.  
- **Automation**: An external webhook is connected to the API to ask for a refresh of the data once a new commit to the `master` branch is performed on the [Yearn Meta](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-meta) repository.


## ðŸ•¸â€‚Data from Subgraph
The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, making data easily accessible. The [Yearn's Subgraph](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-vaults-v2-subgraph/) repository is used to deploy and handle our subgraphs on the supported chainID.

<Callout type={'info'}>
	Subgraph is divided in two "versions", hosted and self-hosted. One is community driven while the other is the official one. Both are used the same way and both can be trusted, the community one acting as a fallback.
</Callout>

### Token List from subgraph
- **Endpoint**: The subgraph address if different for each chainID. For Mainnet, uri is `https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/rareweasel/yearn-vaults-v2-subgraph-mainnet`.
- **Description**: Perform a graphql request to get the list of all tokens that are registered in the subgraph, via a simple query: `{vaults {shareToken {id} token {id}}}`.
- **Trigger**: The Daemon will refresh the data every **1 hour** to assert the data is up-to-date.  
- **Automation**: No other automated is performed.  

## ðŸ”®â€‚Data from Lens Oracle
[Yearn Lens](https://docs.yearn.finance/vaults/yearn-lens/) is a series of smart contracts that aggregate and format Yearn family protocol data into standardized interfaces. The [oracle contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x83d95e0D5f402511dB06817Aff3f9eA88224B030#readContract) is responsible for fetching price information from various sources and is intended for non-critical off-chain calculations. Prices are returned in USDC.
