# API Introduction
You can access the live API at the following URL:

-  **https://ydaemon.yearn.finance/**

Some routes are exposed to get the underlying data from the Yearn ecosystem. The API is currently in beta, and the endpoints are subject to change. If you have any questions or suggestions, please join the Yearn Discord or open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yearn/ydaemon).

## List of endpoints

### Vaults
List vaults that are currently active on the Yearn's ecosystem.
```
[GET  -  `vaults/tvl`]:                          Get the total value locked in the Yearn ecosystem across all vaults for all chains.
[GET  -  `{chainID}/vaults/tvl`]:                Get the total value locked in the Yearn ecosystem across all vaults for a specific chain.
[GET  -  `{chainID}/vaults/all`]:                List the vaults for a specific chain.
[GET  -  `{chainID}/vaults/{address}`]:          Get a specific vault for a specific chain.
[GET  -  `{chainID}/vault/{address}`]:           Get a specific vault for a specific chain. Alias for `{chainID}/vaults/{address}`.
[GET  -  `info/vaults/blacklisted`]:             Get the list of blacklisted vaults (aka ignored vaults).
```

### Strategies
List strategies that are currently active on the Yearn's ecosystem.
```
[GET  -  `{chainID}/reports/{address}`]:         Get the report for a specific strategy for a specific chain.
```

### Meta
Metadata files are difficult to put on-chain, so they are stored in `meta-files` which are updated by the yTeam. This APIs provides a way to access this information.  

```
[GET  -  `api/{chainID}/strategies/all`]:        List the meta for the strategies for a specific chain, as it was on the legacy Meta Repository/API.
[GET  -  `api/{chainID}/strategies/{address}`]:  Get a specific meta for a strategy for a specific chain, as it was on the legacy Meta Repository/API.
[GET  -  `{chainID}/meta/strategies`]:           List the meta for the strategies for a specific chain, using a new standard structure.
[GET  -  `{chainID}/meta/strategies/{address}`]: Get a specific meta for a strategy for a specific chain, using a new standard structure.
[GET  -  `{chainID}/meta/strategy/{address}`]:   Get a specific meta for a strategy for a specific chain, using a new standard structure. Alias for `{chainID}/meta/strategies/{address}`.  

[GET  -  `api/{chainID}/tokens/all`]:            List the meta for the tokens for a specific chain, as it was on the legacy Meta Repository/API.
[GET  -  `api/{chainID}/tokens/{address}`]:      Get a specific meta for a token for a specific chain, as it was on the legacy Meta Repository/API.

[GET  -  `{chainID}/meta/tokens/{address}`]:     Get a specific meta for a token for a specific chain, using a new standard structure.
[GET  -  `{chainID}/meta/token/{address}`]:      Get a specific meta for a token for a specific chain, using a new standard structure. Alias for `{chainID}/meta/tokens/{address}`.  

[GET  -  `api/{chainID}/vaults/all`]:            List the meta for the vaults for a specific chain, as it was on the legacy Meta Repository/API.
