# Models
The `models` package is kind of the same as the `types` folder in Typescript. It's a registry of all the types we may need accross our program, in a separate package so we could use them and call them no matter where we are.   
No logic, or the smallest logic should be implemented in here.   
It's moslty a `give me the struct please` package.
