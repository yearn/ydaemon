**yDaemon** is the next-gen API for Yearn. Based on the one from the [exporter](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-exporter), it brings a lot of new features and benefits without breaking the existing system.

## Quick Start
Ensure [Go](https://go.dev/) is installed on your system. Then, clone the repo and create the `.env` file:
```sh
RPC_URI_FOR_1=
RPC_URI_FOR_250=
RPC_URI_FOR_42161=

# Optional
WEBHOOK_SECRET=
GRAPH_API_URI=
SENTRY_DSN=
SENTRY_SAMPLE_RATE=
LOG_LEVEL=        # DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, SUCCESS, ERROR
```

Then, install, build and run the API:
```bash
go mod vendor
go build -o yDaemon ./cmd
./yDaemon
```

After a few seconds, you should see the API running. You can test it by running the following command:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/1/vaults/all
```

## Data Sources
To build this API, data is fetched from various Yearn data sources:
- [Yearn Subgraph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph?id=5xMSe3wTNLgFQqsAc5SCVVwT4MiRb5AogJCuSN9PjzXF) as the base data source.
- [Yearn Meta](https://github.com/yearn/yearn-meta) for some basic data and information updated by the Yearn team.
- [Yearn API](https://api.yearn.finance/) for the APY computation.
- [Yearn Lens Oracle](https://etherscan.io/address/0xca11bde05977b3631167028862be2a173976ca11) for tokens and vault prices.

To provide a fast and up-to-date experience, a bunch of daemons are summoned with the API, running in the background, forever and ever.
- Prices from the oracle are updated every 30 seconds for every tokens and vaults, as the price may change at every block.
- APY information is updated every 10 minutes, as the underlying API is updated every 30 minutes
- Metadata is updated every day and whenever you deploy yDaemon API.
