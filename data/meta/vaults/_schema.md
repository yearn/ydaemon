# Vaults
The Vaults JSON file contains all the information about the vaults. As other JSON files we use, it is composed of a `lastUpdate` field, a `version` field and a `shouldRefresh` field.
- `lastUpdate`: The last time the file was updated
- `version`: The version of the file (major, minor, patch).
	- `major`: When at least one vault is removed since the last version
	- `minor`: When at least one vault is added since the last version
	- `patch`: When at least one vault is updated since the last version
- `shouldRefresh`: If the file should be refreshed or not. This is used by the bot to know if it should update the file or not, no matter if the other conditions are met.

Each vault contains theses elements:
