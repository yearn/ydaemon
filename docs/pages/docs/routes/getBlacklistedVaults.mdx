# GetBlacklistedVaults
REST API endpoint to list the blacklisted vaults. A vault can be blacklisted for various reason, but mostly because of failed deployment or tests only setup.

```bash
GET info/vaults/blacklisted
```

## What's going on?
The blacklisted vaults are available in the `internal/utils/constants.go` file, as a mapping for each network. The key is the network ID, and the value is the list of blacklisted vaults.  
A blacklisted vault will be ignored by the daemon, and will not be considered as a valid vault for any query.

## Arguments
#### Params
*N/A*

#### Query
- `?chainID`: The chainID of the chain you want to get the Vaults for. If not provided, all chains are used.

## Return Value

```go
map[uint64][]common.Address
```
